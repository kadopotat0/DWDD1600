He graduated from Harvard College in 1755, and for a short time taught school at Worcester, Mass.

Adams was admitted to the bar at Boston in 1758 and began to practice in his hometown. Six years later, he married Abigail Smith, who was to bear three sons and a daughter. She was also the first mistress of the White House and the first woman in U.S. history to be the wife of one President and the mother of another.</dd>
